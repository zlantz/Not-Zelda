# Not-Zelda
Zelda-like 2D game based on MTC Unity tutorial

Based off of "Mister Taft Creates" Youtube Tutorial Series. This project was started to learn Unity and as an intro to game development.
Still a work in progress but most of the scripts have been written.  Many of the objects (like the title screen) are placeholders. I have only created enough of the world to test the things that I need to test.  Once everything else is finished, then I'll work on creating the world/story etc..


Download all the files (minus readme) and extract into a folder
notzelda.exe will run the program
